# activitysim-prototype-mtc

The primary ActivitySim example model.

The `prototype_mtc` example is based on (but has evolved away from) the
[Bay Area Metro Travel Model One](https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/travel-model-one), 
also known as "TM1". TM1 has its roots in a wide array of analytical approaches, 
including discrete choice forms (multinomial and nested logit models), activity 
duration models, time-use models, models of individual micro-simulation with 
constraints, entropy-maximization models, etc. These tools are combined in the 
model design to realistically represent travel behavior, adequately replicate 
observed activity-travel patterns, and ensure model sensitivity to infrastructure
and policies. The model is implemented in a micro-simulation framework. Microsimulation
methods capture aggregate outcomes through the representation of the behavior of
individual decision-makers.
